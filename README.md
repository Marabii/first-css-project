🌐 Simple HTML & CSS Subscription Page
This is a simple subscription landing page created using HTML and CSS, completed as part of a beginner's tutorial. The design features a structured layout for a subscription offer, complete with pricing details and key benefits. It's a great example of fundamental HTML and CSS skills, showcasing the use of layout properties, styling, and color schemes.

🛠️ Technologies Used
HTML5: For structuring the content.

This was the beginning of my journey through web development. The next project that I'll make will feature a landing page for an ecommerce website and I'm going to use Javascript to make it interactive.
